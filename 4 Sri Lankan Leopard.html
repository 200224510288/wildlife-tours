                <p>The Sri Lankan leopard (Panthera pardus kotiya) is a leopard subspecies native to Sri Lanka. It was first described in 1956 by Sri Lankan zoologist Paules Edward Pieris Deraniyagala.[2]

                    Since 2020, the Sri Lankan leopard has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List, as the population is estimated at less than 800 mature individuals, and is probably declining</p>

            <h1>About SriLankan Leopard</h1>
            
            <p>The Leopard (Panthera pardus, Linnaeus, 1758) is the most secretive and elusive of the large carnivores, and also the shrewdest. Pound for pound, it is the strongest climber of the larger cats and is capable of killing prey far larger than itself. However, the leopard is the smallest member of the genus Panthera, which includes the Lion, Tiger and Jaguar. Historically, the leopard had a wide distribution across eastern and southern Asia and Africa, from Siberia to South Africa, with fragmented populations in the Indian subcontinent, Sri Lanka, Indochina, Malaysia, Indonesia and China. Sadly, the range has decreased radically due to over hunting and loss of habitat.

                    <h2>habitats</h2>
                    <p>The best known locations, to find leopards in their natural habitat, in Sri Lanka are of course the Yala National Park and the Wilpattu National Park. While leopards can usually be found in all types of habitat throughout the country, today they are more concentrated in the areas where conservation is most predominant.
                        <br>Sri Lankan leopards are still found in all habitats throughout the island in both protected and unprotected areas. In Sri Lanka's central hills, they occur in forest patches, tea estates, grasslands, home gardens, and pine and eucalyptus plantations.

                    <h2>Diet</h2>
                    <p>Like most cats, it is pragmatic in its choice of diet, which can include small mammals, birds, and reptiles, as well as larger animals. Sri Lankan axis deer make up the majority of its diet in the dry zone. The animal also preys on sambar, barking deer, wild boar, and monkeys.</p>

                    <h2>Behavior</h2>
                    <p>A study in Yala National Park indicates that Sri Lankan leopards are not any more social than other leopard subspecies. They are solitary hunters, with the exception of females with young. Both sexes live in overlapping territories with the ranges of males overlapping the smaller ranges of several females, as well as overlapping the ranges of neighbouring males. They prefer hunting at night, but are also active during dawn and dusk, and daytime hours. They rarely haul their kills into trees, which is likely due to the lack of competition and the relative abundance of prey. Since leopards are the apex predators they don't need to protect their prey.

                        Like most cats, the Sri Lanka leopard is pragmatic in its choice of diet which can include small mammals, birds, reptiles as well as larger animals. Axis or spotted deer make up the majority of its diet in the dry zone. The animal also preys on sambar, barking deer, wild boar and monkeys.
                        
                        The cat has been known to tackle almost fully grown buffalos.
                        
                        The Sri Lankan leopard hunts like other leopards, silently stalking its prey until it is within striking distance where it unleashes a burst of speed to quickly pursue and pounce on its victim. The prey is usually dispatched with a single bite to the throat.
                        
                        There appears to be no birth season or peak, with births scattered across months. A litter usually consists of 2 cubs.</p>

                <p>A recent study has shown that Yala National Park has one of the highest recorded densities of leopards in the world, although this animal is still considered to be endangered. The Wilpattu National Park is also known as a good place to watch leopards. Leopards tend to be more readily observed in parts of Sri Lanka than in other countries.</p>

                        <h2>Distribution.</h2>
                        <p>According to research conducted by WWCT, the distribution of the leopard across the country is about 37% of its range. Historically it used to be spread throughout the island, but it’s no longer found in the South Western areas; it’s also not found in the vast agricultural lands towards Anuradhapura. “It still exists over about 50% of the island, but it actually lives within about 20% and that area is strongly linked with forest cover. This includes protected areas as well which are linked to forest cover because the leopard is reliant on prey. Therefore the forest cover is very important. This is similar in the dry zone evergreen National Parks like Yala, Lunugamwehera, Weheragala, Kumana Udawalawe and Wanni Jungles. The Central hills called Hatton, Dikoya, Nanuoya, Ohiya and Knuckles Horton Plains National Park and Haggala Strict Nature Reserve. In the wet zone they have recorded in Peak Wilderness Sanctuary, Bogawantalawa and Maskeliya. More limited populations are found in the lowland wet zones including Sinharaja forest.</p>

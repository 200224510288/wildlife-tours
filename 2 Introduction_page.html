            <h1>Sinharaja Rain Forest</h1>
            
            <p>Located in south-west Sri Lanka, Sinharaja is the country's last viable area of primary tropical rainforest. More than 60% of the trees are endemic and many of them are considered rare. There is much endemic wildlife, especially birds, but the reserve is also home to over 50% of Sri Lanka's endemic species of mammals and butterflies, as well as many kinds of insects, reptiles and rare amphibians.</p>

                    <h2>Description.</h2>
                    <p>Encompassing the last extensive patch of primary lowland rainforest in Sri Lanka, Sinharaja Forest Reserve is situated in the south-west lowland wet zone of Sri Lanka.  Covering an area of 8,864 ha and ranging from an altitude of 300 – 1,170 meters, it consists of 6,092 ha of Forest Reserve and 2,772 ha of Proposed Forest Reserve. This narrow strip of undulating terrain encompasses a series of ridges and valleys that are crisscrossed by an intricate network of streams. Draining to both the south and north, this detailed matrix of waterways flow into the Gin River on the southern boundary of the property and Kalu River via the Napola Dola, Koskulana Ganga and Kudawa Ganga on its northern boundary. Annual rainfall over the last 60 years has ranged from 3614 - 5006 mm with most of the precipitation during the south-west monsoon (May-July) and the north-east monsoon (November- January).

                     Sri Lanka is home to 830 endemic species, of which 217 trees and woody climbers are found in the low land wet zone. Of these, 139 (64%) have been recorded in the reserve including 16 rare species. Faunal endemism is particularly high for birds with 19 (95%) of 20 species recorded in the property being endemic to Sri Lanka. Endemism among mammals and butterflies is also greater than 50%. A number of threatened, endangered and rare species occur within the reserve including: leopard (Panthera pardus), Indian elephant (Elephas maxiumus), endemic purple-faced Langur (Presbytis senex), Sri Lanka wood pigeon (Columba torringtoni), green-billed Coucal (Centropus chlororrhynchus), Sri Lanka white-headed starling (Sturnus senex), Sri Lanka blue magpie (Cissa ornate), ashy-headed babbler (Garrulax cinereifrons) and Sri Lanka broad-billed roller (Eurystomus orientalis irisi). </p>

                <p>Minneriya National Park is located in Sri Lanka’s North Central Province, 182 kilometers from Colombo. The major cities closest to Minneriya National Park are Habarana and Polonnaruwa.

                    The renovated, vast ancient Minneriya Rainwater Reservoir that irrigates a considerable area of the district of Polonnaruwa is the focal point of the Minneriya National Park.
                    
                    Minneriya National Park, which is part of the elephant corridor that connects Kaudulla and Wasgamuwa National Parks, provides visitors with the opportunity to see elephant herds all year. May to October is the best period to visit Minneriya National Park in view of the world-famous Great Elephant Gathering of the Asian wild elephants.</p>

                        <p>Minneriya National Park is home to the world’s largest known gathering of Asian elephants. During this period, herds of up to 350 elephants are seen at the 8,890-hectare park within a few square kilometers of the Minneriya Tank. According to some reports, there are as many as 700 elephants. In August and September each year, during the dry season, wild elephants migrate from Wasgamuwa National Park to Minneriya National Park in search of food and shelter. Tourists visit Minneriya National Park largely because of elephants, especially in the dry season.</p>
                        <p>Minneriya National Park’s Other Animals :<br>
                            The park is an important habitat for Sri Lanka’s two endemic monkeys, the purple-faced langur and the toque macaque. Large herbivorous mammals such as Sri Lankan sambar deer and Sri Lankan axis deer frequent the park. Rare and endangered species such as the Sri Lankan leopard and Sri Lankan sloth bear inhabit Minneriya. Minneriya is one of the areas where the gray slender loris is reportedly found in Sri Lanka.</p>

                            <br>
                            The Minneriya reservoir is an important habitat for large water birds such as the lesser adjutant, painted stork, and spot-billed pelican. Minneriya is a dormitory for many resident as well as migrant bird species. Flocks of 2000 little cormorants have been reported. The great white pelican, ruddy turnstone, and grey heron are the other water birds here. Among the endemic birds are Sri Lanka jungle fowl, Sri Lanka hanging parrot, brown-capped babbler, Sri Lanka grey hornbill, black-crested bulbul, and crimson-fronted barbet. The number of threatened birds recorded in this national park is 11.</p>

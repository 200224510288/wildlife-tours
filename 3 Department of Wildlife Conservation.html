            <h1>About Department</h1>
            
            <p>Srilankan Department of Wildlife Conservation established in 1949 is the conservation of wildlife resources in Sri Lanka. Accordingly, the sources of water feeding all the main revivers in Sri Lanka and catchment areas of 40 major reservoirs providing water for agriculture and hydro-power generation are protected within this wildlife reservation network which exceed 13% of the total land area of the island. The responsibility of managing this wildlife reservation network is solely falling upon the Department of Wildlife Conservation. This network consists of reservations declared under various reservation levels.

The national park is home to a variety of wildlife species, most notably purple-faced langurs, Sri Lankan leopards, Red Slender Loris, Toque monkeys, magpies, and sambar deer.
